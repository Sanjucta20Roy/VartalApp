> - **Word Breakdown Gloss**: *Swalpa (a little) + chill (relax) + māḍi (do - polite request)*  
> - **Natural English**: *“Let’s chill a little / Relax a bit.”*  
> Displays native script (ಸ್ವಲ್ಪ chill ಮಾಡಿ), readable Latin transliteration, literal vs natural gloss, pronunciation guide, register/politeness flags, verified speaker review audit metadata, and TTS audio.
